# Malayalam Wordle à´®wordle

[Play Mwordle here](https://mwordle.subinsb.com/).

Wordle game adapted for Malayalam language using Manglish script.

[Varnam](https://varnamproject.com/) is used for transliteration and dictionary check. Unlike the original Wordle game, **a backend API server is a requirement** for mwordle.

To know more about the Manglish script used and its rules, [see this](https://varnamproject.com/editor/#/scheme). Choose language as Malayalam from the top bar.

This is a [fork of Evan You's wordle implementation in vue3](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle). I always wanted to check out vue3, finally got the motivation with this. I like vue3.

The original creator(s) of Wordle own all applicable rights to the game itself.
